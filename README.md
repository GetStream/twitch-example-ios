## üìö Tutorial

This repository contains the completed Xcode project following the [How to Build a Twitch Clone Game Live Streaming App for iOS](https://getstream.io/blog/stream-dolby-game-livestreaming-tutorial/) tutorial. You should read it before trying to run this project as it contains it may contain useful information not present in this README.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

## Requirements
- Xcode 11+
- iOS 13+
- A [Stream](https://getstream.io/accounts/signup/) account
- A [Dolby.io](https://dolby.io/organizations/register) account

### Configuration

You should place your [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat) and [Dolby.io](https://dolby.io) credentials in [`AppDelegate.swift`](Smitch/Smitch/AppDelegate.swift#L18-#L23).

### Dependencies

To install the dependencies, use CocoaPods in the Smitch folder:

```bash
